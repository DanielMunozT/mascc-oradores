# MASCC Oradores

This scheduler uses the **MAWC** brand name for the English interface and **MASCC** for the Portuguese and Spanish versions.

## Running Tests

Install Node.js (v18 or later). Then run:

```bash
npm test
```

This executes `translations.test.js`, which verifies that all language objects in `translations.js` share the same set of keys.
